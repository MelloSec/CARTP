## What is PowerZure?

PowerZure is a PowerShell project created to assess and exploit resources within
Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform, Azure. PowerZure was created out of the need for a
framework that can both perform reconnaissance **and** exploitation of Azure, EntraID, and the associated resources.

## Requirements

The "Az" [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-4.2.0) module is the primary module used in PowerZure, as it handles most requests interacting with Azure resources. The Az module interacts using the Azure REST API. It can be installed via PowerShell command `Install-Module -Name Az`

## Usage

RTFM: https://powerzure.readthedocs.io

`ipmo C:\path\to\PowerZure.psd1`

If you have multiple subscriptions, you must set the main subscription with `Set-AzureSubscription`. If you do not do this, things will fail. 

## Additional Resources

You can type `Get-AzureCurrentUser` to view the current signed-in user's roles in Azure and EntraID.

You can also type `Get-AzureTarget` to compare your current signed-in user's roles and their scope to resources within Azure. 

For target finding, I recommend using [AzureHound](https://posts.specterops.io/introducing-bloodhound-4-0-the-azure-update-9b2b26c5e350), the Azure component to [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).
