    .SYNOPSIS
        Runs a command against an App Services host.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function will run a command against an App Services host. This can aid in enumerating environment variables for secrets, obtaining Managed Identities tokens at scale, or searching file systems for configuration files.
    .PARAMETER command
        The command to run against the host.
    .PARAMETER appName
        The name of the application to target.
    .PARAMETER username
        The username for connecting to host. The script will attempt to fetch a username from the publishing profile if not provided.
    .PARAMETER password
        The password for connecting to the host. The script will attempt to fetch a password from the publishing profile if not provided.
    .EXAMPLE
        To run against a single host
        PS C:\MicroBurst> Invoke-AzAppServicesCmd -command "dir D:\home" -appName "Target-App"
    .EXAMPLE
        To run against many hosts and store the results
        PS C:\MicroBurst> Get-AzFunctionApp | ForEach-Object {Invoke-AzAppServicesCmd -command "dir D:\home" -appName $_.Name}
